      <div id = "text">Welcome to Movle a clone of Wordle<br>
        This game takes at least 8 sec to load everything.<br>
        Rules: The movie title is picked from TMDB api and gets English movies. <br>
        Titles are ranging in length from 5-7.<br> 
        If a movie title is two words, then spaces are eliminated.<br>
        I understand some titles you might have never heard of, but that&#39s the fun of it.
